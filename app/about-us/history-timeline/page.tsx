            Archbishop Gabriel M. Reyes was born on March 24, 1892, in Kalibo,
            Capiz, to Filipino parents. At the age of 13, he entered the
            Seminary of Jaro which was then directed by the Vincentian Fathers.
            Bishop Dennis Dougherty of Jaro, who later became Cardinal
            Archbishop of Philadelphia, U.S.A., ordained him on March 27, 1915,
            after which he was immediately appointed Coadjutor Parish Priest of
            the Cardinal becoming in a few months its Parish Priest.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Parish Priest of Balasan (1915) he covered sixteen small islands
            many of which of neither roads nor chapels nor convents, but only
            ruins and an increasing number of Aglipayans and Protestants. These
            became the field of action of the energetic Gabriel until he became
            a Parish Priest of Capiz, Capiz (1918).
          </p>
          <p>
            On July 20, 1820, Bishop James McClosky chose him to be the Diocesan
            Chancellor and Secretary and, at the same time, a Parish Priest of
            Sta. Barbara. In 1927, he became Vicar General of Jaro.
          </p>
          <p>
            On October 11, 1932, Monsignor Gabriel Reyes was ordained Bishop of
            Cebu in the Cardinal of Jaro by the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop
            Guillermo Piani, S.D.B., with the assistance of Bishop James
            McClosky of Jaro and Bishop Alfredo Verzosa of Lipa. Two days later,
            he was installed in Cebu.
          </p>
          <p>
            On April 28, 1934, Cebu, after more than three centuries was
            elevated by Pope Pius XI into an Archdiocese with Bishop Gabriel
            Reyes as the First Archbishop. As the Ecclesiastical Province of
            Santisimo Nombre de Jesus Cebu had for its suffragans in 1934 the
            following: the Diocese of Jaro (1865), Calbayog (1910), Zamboanga
            (1910), Bacolod (1932 detached from Manila), and Cagayan de Oro
            (1933).
          </p>
          <p>
            With the able hands of Archbishop Gabriel Reyes, the Archdiocese
            began to embark on a series of noble projects designed to nurture
            the faith that had already been planted. In September of 1934, the
            weekly newspaper Lungsuranon appeared in its maiden issue. It was to
            help instruct the faithful on the fundamentals of the faith and to
            hold in check the advances of the other sectarian propaganda. The
            Archbishop encouraged the establishment of “Catholic Action” in the
            Parishes of Cebu and Bohol as well as the Catechesis for children
            and the Association of Propagation of Faith. He ordered the holding
            of Diocesan Eucharistic Congresses in all the Parishes of the
            Archdiocese for the preparation of the International Eucharistic
            Congress which was scheduled in Manila in February of 1937. In 1933
            he established in Cebu the Adoracion Nocturna Filipina and in 1940
            the Knights of Columbus. On July 27 - 29, 1937 he convoked the Third
            Diocesan Synod of Cebu where decrees adjusted to the new code of
            Canon Law (1918) were adopted. Truly a pastor of souls, Archbishop
            Reyes himself handled spiritual exercises for the common laborers,
            with hundreds of them attending every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giving concrete responses to the evangelical imperative in works of
            mercy, Archbishop Reyes laid the foundation stone in 1939 for a
            large structure of the Asilo de Milagrosa to take care of the
            orphans and the aged. He supported the Association of St. Vincent de
            Paul to help the poor and the needy. Furthermore, he erected the
            now-defunct Holy Child Hospital with the same purpose in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            To mark the celebration of his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee in 1940,
            Archbishop Reyes embellished the Cathedral erecting therein a marble
            altar which unfortunately did not survive the war. He encouraged
            religious vocation among the youth and ordained every year dozens of
            new candidates to the priesthood. He established the Parishes of
            Guadalupe, Tabuelan, Simala, and Santa Lucia to add to the existing
            parish, and launched a more vigorous evangelization program. He
            started the “Catholic Hour” over the radio station DZRC.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1945 the Treaty of Peace was signed. The Archbishop, pained
            almost to the point of nervous breakdown by the great destruction
            caused by the Second World War, such as the destruction of the
            Cathedral, his residence, the seminary, several churches, convents,
            and colleges, resigned to the will of God, commenced the work of
            reconstruction. His labor did not pass unrecognized for on August
            25, 1949, he was appointed by the Holy Father Pius XII as Coadjutor
            to Archbishop Michael O&apos;Doherty of Manila with right of
            succession (and Apostolic Administrator sede plena). With the death
            of the Archbishop, he took canonical possession of the
            archiepiscopal See of Manila with the distinction of being its first
            Filipino Archbishop (September 29, 1949).
          </p>
          <p>
            Archbishop Gabriel Reyes has the distinction of being succeeded by
            two who have become Princes of the Church: Julio Cardinal Rosales
            who succeeded him in Cebu and Rufino Cardinal Santos who succeeded
            him in Manila.
