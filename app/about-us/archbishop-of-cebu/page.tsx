      <p>
        Jose S. Palma was born on March 19, 1950 to Ruperto and Ester in the
        sleepy town of Dingle, Iloilo. He was raised in the simple town located
        41 kilometers from the city, characterized by its natural beauty, vast
        rice fields and rolling mountains
      </p>
      <p>
        Affectionately called “Nono” by his loved ones, he is the second of
        eight children who all grew up in a humble and grounded family, anchored
        in love and respect. Both his parents brought them up in the Catholic
        faith, and his big happy family served as the foundation of his faith in
        God-- young Nono saw God&apos;s love through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jose&apos;s father served as the barangay chief who was greatly admired
        by the people. His Tatay Ruperto was of great influence to the future
        archbishop, who raised him and his siblings with the virtues of
        humility, kindness, and faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jose grew up as a solemn and silent young boy who also excelled in
        school. He finished his primary education at Calicuang Elementary School
        where he graduated as class valedictorian, and secondary education at
        Mater Carmeli School, Iloilo where his faith formation was strengthened
        by the Carmelite sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jose was initially interested in taking up Engineering, however, his
        faith and the call to priesthood proved stronger and louder. His “fiat”
        or yes to God&apos;s call became a prelude to an extraordinary life of
        service to the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firm in offering himself to the altar of priesthood, he studied
        philosophy at St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary and was among the first
        graduates at St. Joseph Regional Seminary where he studied theology. He
        was ordained on August 21, 1976, the 3rd anniversary of his
        father&apos;s death, a heartfelt demonstration of his great love and
        admiration for his Tatay Ruperto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fr. Palma proceeded to study Licentiate in Sacred Theology (Magna Cum
        Laude) at the University of Santo Tomas, Manila from 1977-1980. After
        completing his studies, he returned to St. Joseph Seminary and served as
        a professor and vice-rector until 1983. He also finished his Doctorate
        in Theology (Magna Cum Laude) at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas
        Aquinas in Rome. He returned to the Seminary once again to serve as its
        rector from 1988-1997.
      </p>
      <p>
        An approachable young priest who mingled with his flock, Fr. Palma then
        expanded his pastoral service as the parish priest of St. Anthony of
        Padua Parish in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo from 1997-1998. He was later
        appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cebu from 1998-1999 and Bishop of Calbayog
        from 1999-2006, where he notably spearheaded the medico-surgical mission
        for the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2006, he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as Archbishop of Palo,
        Leyte. During his tenure, he visited the diocese&apos;s far-flung
        outposts and the peripheries to administer the sacraments and aid
        elderly priests.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a “silent worker and action man” who wants to serve and spend time
        with the people. Known as a humble “barangay bishop”, he frequently
        visits the slums and walks the hinterlands to listen to the stories of
        the voiceless and marginalized, and preach the message of God along the
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On January 13, 2011 he was installed as the fourth Archbishop of Cebu,
        continuing the work of Ricardo Cardinal Vidal who led the Archdiocese
        for more than 28 years. Although the urbanized Archdiocese proved to be
        quite intimidating for the new Shepherd from Samar, he immediately went
        to work, laying down his vision for the Archdiocese as a big family,
        empowering the faithful, ushering in reforms, and hearing the concerns
        of both religious and laypersons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although leading the country&apos;s largest Archdiocese may have its
        share of trials and challenges, the new Archbishop felt comfortable in
        his new post with the immense welcome of the Cebuanos and the support of
        his many collaborators who were willing to help him in his ministry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same year, he was elected president of the Catholic Bishops&apos;
        Conference of the Philippines where he served until 2013. Accepting his
        appointment as CBCP head, he wrote: “unworthy as I am, I accepted the
        appointment out of obedience”- a statement which could be likened to his
        namesake, St. Joseph&apos;s acceptance to be Mary&apos;s spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Archbishop Palma recognizes technology as an effective means of social
        communication at the dawn of a new age. He is known to be tech-savvy,
        looking out for his brother priests, religious and lay faithful by
        communicating with them through text and email. He is also a staunch
        protector of the sanctity of marriage, family and life, speaking out
        against issues involving faith and morality, and renouncing worldly joys
        like wealth, fame and power.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Archbishop of Cebu, he spearheaded the successful celebration of the
        canonization of Visayan martyr, Pedro Calungsod in 2012, and the 51st
        International Eucharistic Congress in 2016. Under his leadership, the
        Archdiocese will again host big ecclesiastical gatherings in 2021 with
        the Quincentennial Anniversary of the Philippine Christianization.
