      "Archbishop Gabriel M. Reyes was born on March 24, 1892, in Kalibo, Capiz, to Filipino parents. At the age of 13, he entered the Seminary of Jaro which was then directed by the Vincentian Fathers. Bishop Dennis Dougherty of Jaro, who later became Cardinal Archbishop of Philadelphia, U.S.A., ordained him on March 27, 1915, after which he was immediately appointed Coadjutor Parish Priest of the Cardinal becoming in a few months its Parish Priest.",
      "As Parish Priest of Balasan (1915) he covered sixteen small islands many of which of neither roads nor chapels nor convents, but only ruins and an increasing number of Aglipayans and Protestants. These became the field of action of the energetic Gabriel until he became a Parish Priest of Capiz, Capiz (1918).",
      "On July 20, 1820, Bishop James McClosky chose him to be the Diocesan Chancellor and Secretary and, at the same time, a Parish Priest of Sta. Barbara. In 1927, he became Vicar General of Jaro.",
      "On October 11, 1932, Monsignor Gabriel Reyes was ordained Bishop of Cebu in the Cardinal of Jaro by the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Guillermo Piani, S.D.B., with the assistance of Bishop James McClosky of Jaro and Bishop Alfredo Verzosa of Lipa. Two days later, he was installed in Cebu.",
      "On April 28, 1934, Cebu, after more than three centuries was elevated by Pope Pius XI into an Archdiocese with Bishop Gabriel Reyes as the First Archbishop. As the Ecclesiastical Province of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus Cebu had for its suffragans in 1934 the following: the Diocese of Jaro (1865), Calbayog (1910), Zamboanga (1910), Bacolod (1932 detached from Manila), and Cagayan de Oro (1933).",
      "With the able hands of Archbishop Gabriel Reyes, the Archdiocese began to embark on a series of noble projects designed to nurture the faith that had already been planted. In September of 1934, the weekly newspaper Lungsuranon appeared in its maiden issue. It was to help instruct the faithful on the fundamentals of the faith and to hold in check the advances of the other sectarian propaganda. The Archbishop encouraged the establishment of “Catholic Action” in the Parishes of Cebu and Bohol as well as the Catechesis for children and the Association of Propagation of Faith. He ordered the holding of Diocesan Eucharistic Congresses in all the Parishes of the Archdiocese for the preparation of the International Eucharistic Congress which was scheduled in Manila in February of 1937. In 1933 he established in Cebu the Adoracion Nocturna Filipina and in 1940 the Knights of Columbus. On July 27 - 29, 1937 he convoked the Third Diocesan Synod of Cebu where decrees adjusted to the new code of Canon Law (1918) were adopted. Truly a pastor of souls, Archbishop Reyes himself handled spiritual exercises for the common laborers, with hundreds of them attending every year.",
      "Giving concrete responses to the evangelical imperative in works of mercy, Archbishop Reyes laid the foundation stone in 1939 for a large structure of the Asilo de Milagrosa to take care of the orphans and the aged. He supported the Association of St. Vincent de Paul to help the poor and the needy. Furthermore, he erected the now-defunct Holy Child Hospital with the same purpose in mind.",
      "To mark the celebration of his Sacerdotal Silver Jubilee in 1940, Archbishop Reyes embellished the Cathedral erecting therein a marble altar which unfortunately did not survive the war. He encouraged religious vocation among the youth and ordained every year dozens of new candidates to the priesthood. He established the Parishes of Guadalupe, Tabuelan, Simala, and Santa Lucia to add to the existing parish, and launched a more vigorous evangelization program. He started the “Catholic Hour” over the radio station DZRC.",
      "In 1945 the Treaty of Peace was signed. The Archbishop, pained almost to the point of nervous breakdown by the great destruction caused by the Second World War, such as the destruction of the Cathedral, his residence, the seminary, several churches, convents, and colleges, resigned to the will of God, commenced the work of reconstruction. His labor did not pass unrecognized for on August 25, 1949, he was appointed by the Holy Father Pius XII as Coadjutor to Archbishop Michael O'Doherty of Manila with right of succession (and Apostolic Administrator sede plena). With the death of the Archbishop, he took canonical possession of the archiepiscopal See of Manila with the distinction of being its first Filipino Archbishop (September 29, 1949).",
      "Archbishop Gabriel Reyes has the distinction of being succeeded by two who have become Princes of the Church: Julio Cardinal Rosales who succeeded him in Cebu and Rufino Cardinal Santos who succeeded him in Manila.",

      "Julio Rosales y Ras also known as Julio Rosales, the second Archbishop of Cebu, was a Filipino cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "A native of Calbayog, he made his studies at the Seminary of Calbayog and was ordained in his hometown on June 2, 1929.",
      "From 1929 to 1946, he did pastoral work in the diocese of Calbayog. He was consecrated bishop of Tagbilaran on September 21, 1946.",
      "On December 17, 1949, Rosales was promoted to the metropolitan see of Cebu. During his reign, in 1965, Cebu hosted the celebrations for the 400th anniversary of the Christianization of the Philippines.",
      "Rosales was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Paul VI in the consistory of April 28, 1969, and given the titular church of Sacro Cuore di Gesù agonizzante a Vitinia. He also participated in both conclaves of 1978. He resigned the pastoral government of his archdiocese, on August 24, 1982, and died less than a year later in Cebu City, his beloved episcopal city.",
      "Julio Rosales is buried at the mausoleum of the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral in Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines. His mementos are currently on display at the Cathedral Museum of Cebu.",

      "Cardinal Ricardo J. Vidal, Archbishop Emeritus of Cebu (Philippines), was born on 6 February 1931 in Mogpoc, Philippines. He did his studies at the minor seminary of the Most Holy Rosary (which later assumed the title of Our Lady of Carmel) and at the seminary of San Carlo.",
      "He was ordained on 17 March 1956. The Bishop of Lucena entrusted him as spiritual director of the local seminary of Mount Carmel. He then became superior of the same institute and was dedicated to the formation of the young candidates to priesthood until 10 September 1971, when he was named Coadjutor Bishop of Malolos, Bulacan, and was elected to the titular church of Claterna. He received episcopal ordination on 30 November 1971. On 22 August 1973, he was named Archbishop of Lipa in Batangas.",
      "On 13 April 1981, he was named Coadjutor with the right of succession to the Archbishop of Cebu, Cardinal Julio Rosales. He was named Archbishop on 24 August 1982.",
      "He served as president of the Bishops' Commission for Vocations within the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. He was also vice-president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference and then president from 1985 to 1987.",
      "Archbishop Emeritus of Cebu (Philippines), 15 October 2010.",

  "The beginnings of the Archdiocese of Cebu began with the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan's fleet in the town of Zubu, ruled by Rajah Humabon and his Queen. The encounter between two different cultures resulted in the baptism of Humabon's 800 subjects and merited for the Queen a gift from the conquistadores--a small statue of the Child Jesus in kingly regalia, the Santo Niño.",
  "The Spanish foothold was resisted by Lapulapu, the chieftain of Mactan, and Magellan perished in what was a traditional rivalry between two chieftains. The defeat of the Spaniards proved the superiority of Lapulapu and pushed Cebuanos back into paganism.",
  "The expedition of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1567 marked the evangelization of Cebu and the Philippine islands. This time, the Cebuanos were determined to fight but Legazpi too, had come prepared and had the village bombarded before coming ashore for crown and cross.",
  "The Spanish soldier Juan de Camus found the image of the Santo Niño and the Cebuanos' stillborn faith among the ashes and debris. But the cross was soon to be planted again in their village as a reminder that while the Cebuanos resisted the authority of the Spaniards, their hearts had fallen for the smile of the Little Child who holds the world in his hand.",
  "The faith spread rapidly to the neighboring islands with the help of the Augustinian missionaries who came with the expedition and it did not take very long before the whole island came under the shadow of the cross.",
  "When Legazpi transferred his capital to Manila, Cebu receded into the backwaters as influence and power shifted to Luzon. The Diocese of Cebu, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Manila, extended west to Panay, east to the Marianas, and the whole of Mindanao. This extensive area posed a daunting task to the limited number of missionaries who had to spread the Gospel to far-flung outposts of the Diocese.",
  "To help in preaching the Gospel in the native tongue, the missionaries trained young catechists and educated them in seminarios run by the Jesuits in Cebu and Bohol. This included Pedro Calungsod, the Visayan lay catechist and saint who perished with the Jesuit Diego de Sanvitores in 1672 in an attempt to evangelize the Marianas.",
  "Distance having shielded the fledgling Diocese from the intrigues and power struggles of the Capital, much of Cebu's ecclesiastical history is a leisurely narrative of arrivals and foundations, of synods and celebrations.",
  "The arrival of the missionaries was a welcome relief for a diocese as expansive as Cebu. The Augustinians arrived with Legazpi and immediately built a shrine for the Santo Niño. The first bishop of Cebu, Fray Pedro de Agurto, established the primary ecclesiastical structures of the islands through the first Diocesan Synod in 1600 which provided guidelines for the teaching of Christian doctrine.",
  "The successful control of the Moro raids and native resistance brought relative peace, stability, and development in the Islands and sped up the foundation of ecclesiastical units throughout the Diocese. From a fledgling ecclesiastical jurisdiction struggling to establish itself in its vast territory, the Diocese of Cebu finally found stability in the 19th century when it began to turn its attention to the material needs of its people.",
  "The Jesuits, Augustinians and Recollects founded stone churches and convents. Schools and hospitals were also established under the guidance of religious orders and local bishops, including “Hospital de Lazarinos”, “Casa de Socorro de Cebu” and the former “Colegio de San Carlos”, presently the University of San Carlos.",
  "The relative peace and stability of the 19th century belied the seething cauldron of popular disenchantment with the Spanish rule. The local uprising of Leon Kilat, the separation of the Church from its traditional partnership with the State, the Aglipayan schism and other problems characterized a particularly stormy period in the history of the Diocese. Seasoned by similar difficulties in the past, the Church in Cebu managed to survive against all odds under the new colonial order.",
  "The Filipinization of the local church radically increased the number of Filipino priests in the Diocese which constituted majority of the parish administration in contrast to the Spanish era. Fr. Juan B. Gorordo, succeeded Bishop Thomas Hendrick in 1910 as the first Filipino Bishop of Cebu. On April 28, 1936, Cebu was elevated into an Archdiocese by Pope Pius XI with the suffragan dioceses of Jaro, Calbayog, Zamboanga, Bacolod, and Cagayan de Oro.",
  "World War II dislocated the new Archdiocese with old churches and the Cathedral reduced into rubble. The task of post-war reconstruction fell upon Archbishop Julio Rosales who began his term in 1950. His incumbency proved to be the longest and one of the most fruitful for the Archdiocese, which included the celebration of the 4th Centenary of the Christianization of the Philippines in 1965. Not long after, the Archbishop was raised to the College of Cardinals, making Cebu one of the few Archdioceses in the world to merit a Cardinal as Archbishop.",
  "Cardinal Rosales' co-adjutor, then Msgr. Ricardo Vidal, succeeded him as Archbishop of Cebu in 1983. Msgr. Vidal was initially reluctant to accept the heavy responsibility of administering an Archdiocese whose culture and traditions are different from his former environment, but his quiet ways and conciliatory stance quickly won the affection and devotion of the Cebuanos.",
  "Gifted with expansive vision, the new Archbishop quickly set out to put his stamp upon the face of the Archdiocese. In January 15, 1984, he announced the convocation of a Diocesan Synod, the fourth in the history of Cebu, to “review the progress attained by the Archdiocese in the last 50 years of its existence” and “provide for the pressing pastoral needs in the coming decades”.",
  "Archbishop Vidal was elevated to the College of Cardinals on May 25, 1985 and the Synod formally opened shortly after on November 10, 1895. Under the Cardinal's leadership, the assembly of clerics and lay people formulated a guiding vision for the Archdiocese in the third millennium.",
  "The 4th Centenary of Cebu as a Diocese comes at a time when the vision of the Synod has begun to transform the structural landscape of the Archdiocese. The seeds of the basic ecclesial communities, sown right after the Synod, has begun to bear fruit in the lives of the faithful.",
  "Looking back to the 400 years of growth and development, there is much to be thankful for. But as Cardinal Vidal put it, the greater reason to celebrate is that we have been privileged enough to be the ones to celebrate. God has placed us in this unique time and place to be able to celebrate the Diocese's 400 years of existence. Not everyone has been given such an opportunity.",
  "With every privilege, however, there is a corresponding responsibility: that as we celebrate the past, we also inaugurate the future. Lest we forget, 400 years is but a chapter in the continuing history of the Archdiocese of Cebu.",
